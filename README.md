# Farfetch Front End Developer Challenge

Within Marketing at Farfetch we are presented with a wide range of requests which cover different technology stacks, please use this as a showcase to demonstrate your skills and more importantly enjoy the challenges!

## Part 1

The following [index.ftl](./task1/task1.ftl) is a [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directives.html) file which will be used as the base template for our new email campaign. Can you code a solution which will display the [following design](./task1/module_design.jpg) (mobile and tablet/desktop) using the products in the array, taking into consideration media queries (breakpoint 960px) and older email clients such as Outlook. 

We will run the code through the [following tool](https://try.freemarker.apache.org/) and test the subsiquent markup using Litmus.

If you do not feel comfortable with FreeMarker you may use an alternative but provide us with a breakdown of your approach and documentation of how to run the build.

## Part 2

The following [link](https://www.farfetch.com/uk/plpslice/listing-api/query?setId=9645&view=180&gender=Men) is a REST API endpoint which contains real-time data for our New In Menswear Set.

Please create a JS application which will output products from this feed. Output these products with images; 2 column for mobile and 3 for tablet/desktop using the breakpoint 960px.

Bonus points for:

- Including designer name, description, anchor and hover image of product.
- Add a filter which allows the user to select the brands available within the feed.

Upon completion please store these tasks in a repository and provide us with the link.
